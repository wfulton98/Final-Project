Being a clever child, Parker keeps a log of the cereals he has eaten, how much he enjoyed them, and various characteristics he suspects affect his enjoyment of a cereal. If Parker has had the cereal in a given row, there is a nonzero rating in each column corresponding to a feature characteristic of that cereal. 0s correspond to a lack of a particular feature for a particular cereal (e.g., Fruity Pebbles are do not contain marshmallows and do not contain chocolate, and Count Chocula has both marshmallows and chocolate, and Parker rated it as a 4).\n",
